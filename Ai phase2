Project Title: prediction of house price by using machine learning

Project Overview:
The project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and data analytics to analyse prices of the house,and predicting price by requirements

Data Collection:
Web Scraping: Collect house price data from the ROC website or database using web scraping tools like Beautiful Soup (Python) or specialized data extraction tools.
APIs: If the ROC provides APIs, use them to access the data programmatically.
u
 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct inconsistencies in the data.
Data Transformation: Convert data into a suitable format for analysis, such as time-series data or structured databases.

Data Storage:
   Relational Database: Store the cleaned and preprocessed data in a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB, depending on the data's structure.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Statistical Tools: Use tools like Pandas, NumPy, and libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and initial insights.
Time Series Analysis: Analyse trends, seasonality, and patterns in company registration data using methods like ARIMA or Prophet.
 Machine Learning Models:
Predictive Modelling: Develop machine learning models like regression, decision trees, random forests, or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or GRU) to predict future company registration trends.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features from the data, such as lag variables, moving averages, or economic indicators.
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to evaluate model performance.

 AI and Predictive Analytics: 
Time Series Forecasting: Implement time series forecasting techniques to predict future registration trends.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilize NLP techniques to analyse textual data related to company registrations, such as company descriptions or reasons for registration.

 Deployment and Visualization: 
Web Application: Create a web-based dashboard or application using frameworks like Flask or Django to make predictions accessible to users.
Visualization Tools: Use tools like Plotly, D3.js, or Tableau for interactive data visualization to present registration trends and insights.

 Monitoring and Updates:
Implement automated data updates and model retraining to ensure the predictions stay relevant over time.
Set up alerts for significant deviations from predicted trends.

 Ethical Considerations: 
Ensure data privacy and security compliance.
Address bias in the data and models.
